Require.js looks nice. I looked into the following:
http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/
https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials/tree/gh-pages/examples/modular-backbone/js
https://github.com/thomasdavis/backboneboilerplate/tree/gh-pages/js
https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/tree/master/assets

and AMD looks great.

However, I think we can get away with Cassette for now.

Cassette includes:
-bundling
-modules (http://getcassette.net/documentation/AssetReferences)
-JST (no need for require!text\myTemplate.html)

Backbone boilerplaters looked okay too. Most were focused on AMD and some had scaffolding for application init.
Some had global ideas setup too (global events). However, I think Backbone.Marionette looks promising so I'll start with that next.
